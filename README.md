To use this project just download the H5pyList.py file then import H5pyList from that file and you're good to go.
To see examples of how to use it check the ExampleUse folder. This version also includes label_from_key which is useful if your file also contains a dataset with labels.

Your file should contain all of your images in a single dataset within an h5py file. If each dataset is a single image you can check out the old version in the old folder.
